# ATM-Interface-Gui
This code is a Java implementation of a simple ATM interface that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. The program uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to display a text field where the user can enter a deposit or withdrawal amount and a text area to display the transaction history and current balance.
